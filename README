Overview
--------

This is a barebones reference management system intended to be used with a git
repository of publication .pdfs and BibTeX citations. I find
Zotero/Mendeley/etc. to be to clunky and I can accomplish all the capabilities
I need in > 100 lines of Python.

Motivation
----------

I read and cite a lot of papers, and therefore I desire this process to be strealined. The capabilities I need are enumerated below:

1. I want to be able to open any reference from the command line as a .pdf, without opening a browser and loging in to some site.
2. I want choose the names for the .pdf files.
3. I want a single BibTeX .bib file containing all citations and the nicknames of the citations must match the filenames of the .pdf
4. I want to be able to create a child .bib file containing only the references I need in the master .bib file for any given LaTeX project.

That's it -- nothing else. I understand that by using real reference management
software I would a lot of features ``for free'' (e.g. searching, sharing,
importing citations from Elsevier, etc). They above 4 criteria take precedent
over all of these features.
